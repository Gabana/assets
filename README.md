# Inter/sections assets

This repository should contain all the latest up-to-date assets we need for Inter/sections design over the years.

## Getting it

If you're on the design team please **clone** this repository locally rather than downloading a ZIP file, it will make it easier to update when things are updated or added. If you wish to add new things in general you should be given push access as you join the team; otherwise you can always submit a PR (particularly if you're making a change to an asset that may be controversial or big and needs review).

Each folder has its own README so you're encouraged to dig in to get details about what's in there, and how you should maintain new folders in the future.

## What should be here

Logos, fonts, logos from sponsors, swatches, templates, images that we use often (eg speakers, previous years' pictures as illustrations), basically stuff that is reused often.

What should **NOT** go here: single-use applications of these elements. These should go to their own repository if they are big and have multiple elements (the [website](https://github.com/mat-intersections/intersections.io), the [APP posters](https://github.com/mat-intersections/APP-posters-template), the bookletâ€¦). In general big pictures that are seldom reused will be on the Google Drive, in the DESIGN + MARKETING folder.

What also doesn't go here is the pattern library which describes *how* to use the elements available in this repo. This can be [consulted here](https://mat-intersections.github.io/pattern-library/).

## License & use

The Symposium's own assets in this repository are **copyrighted** under the Berne convention. In short: even though these assets are publicly viewable on GitHub, you are **not allowed to use the same logo or colour palette or make derivatives** for your own event. Where applicable (e.g. a partnership with us) you can use the logo to refer to our event, but you must follow recommendations on the logo use defined in the pattern library, and you may not use other parts of our identity (colours, typography) without our prior written consent.

See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more details.

Fonts and sponsors logos do not belong to Inter/sections. Where available, see relevant folders for the individual licensing details.
