This folder contains the vector files of our sponsors' logo, which are usually super hard to find in good quality. Some of these are available in more versions on the Google Drive if ever needed (eg greyscale and monochrome versions).

**We do not claim copyright on any of the logos present in this folder and they are only here as usage to demonstrate partnership.**

### MAT
The new MAT logo was not released as a vector but Nick promised to eventually give it when it's finished. For now this bitmap version is big enough for most uses unless you have to recolour it.

### C4DM
In 2017 the C4DM logo should normally not be used on communication as we do not really collaborate this year. That said this repo is the only place you'll find a good vector of it because I had to remake it last year (yey), otherwise it only exists as a low-res bitmap or a very badly traced vector, so enjoy it for future years.
