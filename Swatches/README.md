This folder contains swatches for easily using all the colours from our wonderful palette, designed by GÃ bana. Instructions on using the Sass names are in the [pattern library](https://mat-intersections.github.io/pattern-library/#colour). The ASE (Adobe Swatch Example) file contains all colours in folders and can be imported in InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator (and maybe Sketch? tbc). It's RGB only though, we might want to consider making a real CMYK version.
