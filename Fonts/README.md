This folder contains the fonts we use, [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) and [Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro/). More weights and italics may be available in the original repositories, but in general we stick to the weights available here.

The **webfonts** folder contains subsets of the fonts in WOFF suitable for web usage, for reducing the filesize. For example the Office Code font only has uppercase letters, basic punctuation and numbers.

These fonts are released under the SIL license (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)); copies are placed here for convenience only, we do not own these fonts.
