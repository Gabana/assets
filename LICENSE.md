## Logo and colour scheme

The logos and colour palette cannot be used or modified for purposes other than the Inter/sections run by the Media and Arts Technology programme from QMUL in London. In other words, you are not allowed to use the same logo or colour palette, or make derivatives, for your own event, without our prior written consent. If you would like to make an identity for your own event we however encourage you to do a [pattern library](https://mat-intersections.github.io/pattern-library/) (which we also forked from the Bela project).

## Other assets

Some assets in this repository (fonts and sponsors logos) do not belong to Inter/sections. Where available, see relevant folders for the individual licensing details.
