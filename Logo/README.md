This folder contains the logo in different formats. You should use:

* EPS for print (it can be placed in any Adobe software). **NOTE**: for now these are still RGB and should be converted to CMYK!
* PNG for web
* SVG for web (vector) when possible, or when a vector is required but EPS cannot be used (Sketch?)

The .ai file at the root (here) **should not be used** and seldom edited; it contains all variations above as different artboards. The only time when you should edit it is for a new year (eg the 2018 edition, to re-generate the year mark). If you need a vector use the EPS exports.

Follow the [pattern library](https://mat-intersections.github.io/pattern-library/#logo) to know how to use, and how *not* to use the logo.

## Naming scheme

In 90% of cases the one you'll want is called **intersections-landscape.ext**.

- files containing **-2017** contain the 2017 year mark on them, the others do not have it and should be used to refer to the event in general. (note the bounding box is adjusted accordingly; there's more space under 2017)
- **landscape** should generally be used, but for some applications **-portrait** might be preferred
- Files with **-white** have the text (and 2017 mark, when applicable) inverted, when the logo is used on a darker background. Please do use these files rather than editing the colour yourself, as there are also small optical corrections to adjust contrast (e.g. the slash bar is slightly thicker).
